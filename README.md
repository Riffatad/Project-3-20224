# Project-3-20224
For this project, we chose the data visualization track, where our group tells a story using data visualizations based on the progression of electric vehicles over time in the state of Washington. The dataset that we chose shows the Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) that are currently registered through Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL). 

Requirements:
Project must include visualizations. The visualizations can be created with:
Python (e.g. Matplotlib, Pandas plotting, hvplot)
JavaScript (e.g. Plotly or Leaflet)
A Python or JavaScript visualization library that was not covered in class
Data must be stored in and extracted from at least one database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc).
Your project must include at least one JavaScript OR Python library that we did not cover.
Your project must be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records.
Your project must include some level of user-driven interaction, such as:
HTML menus, dropdowns, and/or textboxes to display JavaScript-powered visualizations
Flask backend with interactive API routes that serve back Python or JavaScript created plots
Visualizations created from user-selected filtered data, which could be powered by:
JavaScript libraries
Python in Jupyter Notebook
Command-line Python scripts that save visualizations locally

Overview:
We chose this topic in order to highlight the rise of electric vehicles from 1997 through 2024. Electric vehicles have become a very hot topic of discussion in recent years as they continue to compete with the gas fueled cars market.
