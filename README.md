# Project-3-20224

## Overview
This project explores the progression of electric vehicles (EVs) in the state of Washington over time,
 using data visualizations to tell a story about the rise of electric vehicles.
  Our dataset, provided by the Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL), 
  includes records of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) currently registered in the state.
   The data spans from 1997 to 2023, capturing the growth of EVs as they increasingly compete with traditional gasoline-powered vehicles.

## Requirements:
Our project will include visualizations created using:

- Python (e.g., Matplotlib, Pandas plotting, hvplot)
- JavaScript (e.g., Plotly or Leaflet)
- A Python or JavaScript visualization library that was not covered in class 

### The data will be stored in and extracted from at least one database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite).

- Our project will also feature at least one JavaScript or Python library that was not covered in class.

- Our project will be powered by a dataset containing at least 100 records.


## Our project will include some level of user-driven interaction, such as:

- HTML menus, dropdowns, and/or textboxes to display JavaScript-powered visualizations

- Flask backend with interactive API routes that serve back Python or JavaScript created plots


## Visualizations created from user-selected filtered data, which could be powered by:

- JavaScript libraries
- Python in Jupyter Notebook
- Command-line Python scripts that save visualizations locally
